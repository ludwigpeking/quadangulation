# Project Description

This project aims to test the quadangulation algorithm for some stylized modeling, simulation of urbanism, which I learned from the grid that is used by Oskar St√•lberg in his game, Townscaper.

Due to the difference in algorithmic specificty, there is difference in the effects of it from Oskar's original.
